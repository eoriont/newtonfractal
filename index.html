        <h3>How to use:</h3>
        <p>Welcome to oriont's newton fractal!</p>
        <p>Made using a combination of javascript and webgl, this fractal generator uses the accelerated power of
          your graphics card to compute the color of each pixel.
        </p>
        <p>I test it using a GTX 970, and this program definitely gets the fan running. That means if you have
          a worse graphics card than mine, proceed with caution!
        </p>
        <p>Using it is simple:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The input box for the equation is in the top left.</li>
          <li>The help menu is the button marked '?' next to the input box.</li>
          <li>After you input an equation and press 'enter', it will show up on the canvas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some things to note while inputting equations:</h3>
        <p>My math parser and differentiator are rushed pieces of garbage, so they only work with certain formats.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>DO: use z as the complex variable in f(z).</li>
          <li>DO: use sin and cos</li>
          <li>DO: use m as the position of the mouse in complex coordinates</li>
          <li>DO: Make polynomials!</li>
          <li>DON'T: use any other trig functions, including hyperbolic. (I haven't implemented them yet!)</li>
          <li>DON'T: use e or logarithms. (I haven't implemented them yet.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I probably haven't gotten all the (general) things that you can and can't do, so if you accidentally
           input an unrecognized equation and either the parser or the differentiator has an error, it will highlight the
           box in red and not do anything.</p>
        <p>If this happens, just put in a different equation.</p>
        <p>If the entire site crashes, just reload and don't use that equation, I guess.</p>
